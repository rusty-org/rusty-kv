# Changes Overview

## 1. src/resp/value.rs

This is where the fundamental change begins:

- Changed `to_command()` method's return type from
  `Option<(String, Vec<String>)>` to `Option<(String, Vec<Value>)>`
- Instead of converting all arguments to strings, we're now preserving their
  original data types
- Added better type handling for numeric values, allowing integers to remain as
  `Value::Integer` instead of converting them to strings
- This change enables type-preserving command processing throughout the system

## 2. src/commands/executor.rs

This file was modified to accommodate the type preservation:

- Changed the `execute()` method signature to accept `Vec<Value>` instead of
  `Vec<String>`
- Added a conversion step that maps different Value types to strings for
  backward compatibility:
  ```rust
  let string_args: Vec<String> = args
    .iter()
    .map(|v| match v {
      Value::SimpleString(s) => s.clone(),
      Value::BulkString(s) => s.clone(),
      Value::Integer(i) => i.to_string(),
      Value::Boolean(b) => b.to_string(),
      _ => "".to_string(),
    })
    .collect();
  ```
- Updated command calls to pass both the string arguments (for backward
  compatibility) and the original Value objects
- Now passes the original Value objects to the SET command, allowing it to
  preserve data types

## 3. src/commands/general/set.rs

This file implements the SET command and was updated to handle typed values:

- Added a new parameter `orig_args: Vec<Value>` to receive the original typed
  values
- Changed how values are extracted and stored to preserve their original type:
  ```rust
  let value = if orig_args.len() > 1 {
    orig_args[1].clone()
  } else {
    Value::SimpleString(args[1].clone())
  };
  ```
- Updated the argument parsing logic to use indexes rather than removing
  elements
- Improved value display in debug logs to show appropriate string representation
  based on type
- Now the SET command can store integers, booleans, and strings with their
  original types preserved

## 4. src/commands/acl/whoami.rs

Only had a minor change in the order of imports (rearranging the `anyhow`
imports).

The overall improvement is significant: your database system now preserves data
types throughout the command execution pipeline, instead of converting
everything to strings. This makes your system more robust and provides better
data integrity when retrieving values later.
